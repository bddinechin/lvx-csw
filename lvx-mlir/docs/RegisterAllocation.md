# Register allocation design: linear scan

Status: all three steps implemented and tested (`-lvx-print-live-intervals`,
`-lvx-allocate-registers` with spill/restore); Steps 1 and 2 committed
(`cef43a89a18b`, `9087a6a37350`), Step 3 not yet committed. See ``
for related design notes as they're added.

## Goal and source

Register allocation for the `lvx`/`lvx_cf`/`lvx_scf`/`lvx_func` dialect
family (see the top-level `CLAUDE.md`), based on:

> Massimiliano Poletto and Vivek Sarkar, "Linear Scan Register Allocation,"
> ACM TOPLAS 21(5), 1999. (`~/Downloads/Poletto_1999_TOPLAS.pdf`)

Implementation is planned in three steps:

1. Compute live intervals over the control-flow graph linearized in
   depth-first order.
2. Register assignment only (Fig. 1 of the paper, `SpillAtInterval`
   replaced by a hard error) — bail out if there aren't enough
   architectural registers.
3. Full linear scan including spill/restore.

## How this differs from the paper's setting

The paper's algorithm targets a **non-SSA** "RTL-like quads" model where one
variable name can be redefined multiple times (hence "holes" in a live
range — see its Fig. 2/§4.1). Our IR is SSA: every `!lvx.reg` value has
exactly one definition point (an op result, or a block argument standing in
for a phi). Per-value interval computation is therefore *simpler* than the
paper's general case — no "multiple defs of the same name" bookkeeping.
Loop-carried values (`lvx_scf.for` iter_args) are just ordinary SSA values
defined once at the loop body's entry.

We still adopt the paper's core simplification for interval *shape*: one
contiguous `[start, end]` bracket per value, holes ignored. That's what
"step 3, no interval splitting" means below.

**Pass granularity**: one function (`lvx_func.func`) at a time, matching
the paper (no interprocedural analysis) — an `OperationPass<lvx_func::FuncOp>`,
or a walk over them from a module pass.

## Step 1 — Live intervals over a DFS-linearized CFG

### Numbering scheme

The paper is explicit that "depth-first order" means the *reverse* of
postorder (the reverse of the order nodes are last visited in a preorder
traversal) — i.e. **reverse postorder (RPO)**, not preorder DFS itself
(§3, paragraph on instruction ordering). That's the standard ordering for
forward dataflow problems: for a reducible CFG it visits a block's
non-back-edge predecessors before the block itself.

Default: RPO over the function's blocks (`llvm::ReversePostOrderTraversal`
adapted to `Block*` successors), then number every *operation* sequentially
within each block in that order. Block arguments are numbered at their
block's first slot (their definition point).

### `lvx_scf.for` in a block-based DFS order

`lvx_scf.for` doesn't correspond to a CFG edge — from the outer block's
point of view it's a single operation with a nested region, not a branch.
Two concerns:

1. **Numbering**: number the loop body's block *inline*, right after the
   `lvx_scf.for` op's own number, recursing into the (single) nested block
   before continuing with the rest of the outer block. Everything stays in
   one flat, monotonically increasing numbering; RPO doesn't need to treat
   the loop as a graph node.
2. **Loop-carried extension** (the important one): a value defined
   *outside* the loop and used *inside* its body must be treated as live
   across the *entire* loop body, not just up to its last textual use
   before the op — the body executes multiple times, and on iteration 2+
   that value must still be valid. This mirrors the concern the CGO'25
   Snitch-backend paper calls out in its own allocator (§3.3).

   **Empirical finding (supersedes the paragraph above)**: no bespoke
   extension rule turned out to be necessary. Because the loop body is
   numbered *inline* (point 1), a use inside the body is just a normal,
   later-numbered use of the outer value from the interval-builder's point
   of view — extending `end` to "the last point the value is used" already
   covers it correctly, with no special-casing for the loop terminator.
   Verified by probing the existing upstream `-test-print-liveness` pass
   against a hand-built `lvx_scf.for` with an outer-captured operand before
   writing any of our own code: `mlir::Liveness`'s per-block live-out sets
   already include values captured into a nested region's ops, which is a
   second, independent way the same answer falls out (see below).

### Source of raw liveness

Reuse `mlir::Liveness` (`mlir/Analysis/Liveness.h`) for per-block
live-in/live-out sets rather than hand-writing iterative dataflow — it
already does a correct fixpoint computation and works over nested regions.
The paper assumes "live variable information obtained via data-flow
analysis" as the input to its one-pass interval-building step (§4); this is
exactly that shape. Correctness matters more than compile speed here, so we
skip the paper's *alternative* fast reducible-CFG-only interval method
(§6/related discussion) as an unneeded optimization.

**Verified**: `mlir::Liveness` correctly includes a value captured from an
outer scope into a nested `lvx_scf.for` region in that region's live-in/
live-out sets, confirmed by probing the pre-existing upstream
`-test-print-liveness` pass against a hand-built loop before writing any of
our own code — no hand-rolled "union in captured operands" workaround was
needed.

### Implementation shape (as built)

The implementation (`mlir/{include,lib}/mlir/Dialect/LVX/Analysis/LiveIntervals.{h,cpp}`)
does three passes over the numbered instruction stream:

1. Seed each value's `start` at its definition point (block argument or op
   result), and detect `fixedReg` from `!lvx.reg<rN>` types.
2. Extend `end` by directly scanning every operand of every op in numbering
   order — this alone is sufficient for correctness, including the loop
   case above, given inline loop-body numbering.
3. Extend `end` again using `mlir::Liveness`'s per-block `out()` sets, as a
   defensive safety net for any pass-through-block case the direct scan
   might miss. Empirically this pass turned out to be redundant (it never
   changed the result on any test case, including the loop test) given pass
   2, but it's kept since it's cheap and guards against a class of bug
   (values live across a block with no direct reference in it) that direct
   operand-scanning alone doesn't obviously rule out for more complex CFGs
   than the ones tested so far.

### Building intervals

Single linear pass over the numbered instruction stream, per the paper's
"given live variable info, one pass suffices" (§4): walk in numbering
order, track a running `start`/`end` per value. First time a value is seen
live (via block livein, seeded from `Liveness`, or via its own def) sets
`start`; every point it's live extends `end`. Apply the loop-carried
extension rule as a post-pass (or inline when descending into a `for`
body).

### `lvx_scf.for`'s induction variable and `step` need an explicit interval extension (fixed)

Both `-lvx-scf-to-cf` lowering paths synthesize an in-place
`iv = iv + step` increment immediately before the loop body's terminator
— but that pass runs *after* this one, so the increment doesn't exist as
an SSA op yet when intervals are built here. If the body's *original* IR
has no other use of `iv` past some point (or, for `step`, no use inside
the body at all — it's only ever the `for` op's own operand), the
computed interval ends there, long before the body's actual end where the
synthesized increment will read it back. Every hand-written test in this
project's history happened to never read `iv` inside a loop body, so this
went unnoticed until a real kernel that does (one that uses its induction
variable for more than just the implicit per-iteration bump) was run
end to end — see `EndToEndValidation.md` for the concrete
failure (a squared-iv accumulation silently computed the wrong answer).
Fixed by explicitly extending both the induction variable's (body block
argument 0) and `step`'s intervals to the body's last instruction, for
every `lvx_scf.for`, alongside the ordinary def/use walk — the same class
of "implicit use invisible to generic dataflow" as call-crossing (Step 2).

### Pre-colored / fixed intervals

ABI-pinned values already exist as `!lvx.reg<rN>` in the IR (function entry
args, `lvx.mv`-pinned returns) — these aren't allocation candidates, they're
*constraints*: their register is fixed for their (short) live range, and
the allocator must not hand that register to anything else during that
window. Represent them as intervals with a `fixedRegister` field rather
than skipping them, so step 2's scan naturally sees the conflict. (Call
sites reuse the same mechanism — see Step 2.)

### Data structure

```
struct LiveInterval {
  Value value;
  unsigned start, end;
  std::optional<Register> fixedReg;
};
```

Collected into a vector, sorted by `start` ascending at the end (Fig. 1's
precondition).

### Testing

Expose this as a standalone analysis/pass pair — an `LVXLiveIntervals`
analysis class plus a thin `-lvx-print-live-intervals` test pass
(`mlir/test/lib/Dialect/LVX/TestLiveIntervals.cpp`), mirroring the existing
`TestLiveness.cpp` convention already in this tree
(`mlir/test/lib/Analysis/TestLiveness.cpp`) so it's FileCheck-testable
independent of steps 2/3.

**Gotcha (hit and fixed while building this)**: an `OperationPass<lvx_func::FuncOp>`
runs once per function in the module, and MLIR's pass manager runs those
instances *concurrently by default* when there's more than one sibling
function. A test pass that prints via `llvm::outs()` will hit a
`raw_ostream::SetBufferAndMode` assertion (buffered stream, concurrent
writers); `llvm::errs()` (unbuffered) avoids the crash but still
interleaves output byte-by-byte across functions, corrupting FileCheck
output. Fix used here, matching `TestLiveness.cpp`'s convention: print via
`llvm::errs()` *and* pass `-mlir-disable-threading` in the RUN line
(`2>&1 | FileCheck %s`, since `errs()` is stderr) — this applies to any
future per-function test pass in this tree, not just this one.

## Step 2 — Register assignment only, bail out on pressure

Fig. 1's `LinearScanRegisterAllocation` + `ExpireOldIntervals` verbatim,
with `SpillAtInterval` replaced by a hard error.

### Free register pool

From `Convention-lvx_v1-regular`: exclude `R12` (stack pointer) and `R13`
(local/TLS) always — the other 62 GPRs are candidates. `R14` (frame
pointer) stays allocatable at this stage: step 2 has no stack frame /
spilling yet, so there's no frame pointer to protect. Revisit once step 3
needs a frame.

### Allocation order

Mirror the *separate* LVX LLVM backend's stated preference
(`LVXRegisterInfo.td`, in the sibling `lvx-llvm` repo:
`../lvx-llvm/llvm-project/llvm/lib/Target/LVX/`) for consistency:
argument/result registers `R0-R11` first, then other
caller-saved scratch (`R15-R17`, `R32-R60`), then callee-saved (`R14`,
`R18-R31`) last — using a callee-saved register costs a prologue/epilogue
save/restore pair, so it is preferred last.

`R61-R63` are absent from both runs: they are the reserved spill scratch
(see "Reserved scratch registers"), held out of the general pool.

**Callee-saved registers are saved and restored** (this was a real ABI bug
until 2026-08-04: they were allocated freely, but nothing ever preserved
them, so any `lvx-gcc`-compiled caller with a live value in `R18` got it
silently clobbered). After assignment, the pass collects every distinct
callee-saved register appearing in the function's final value types —
walking the types rather than the allocated items, so that registers pinned
by other means are caught too: ABI-pinned entry arguments, and
`RewriteDivmod`'s result pair, neither of which is an allocation item —
reserves an 8-byte frame slot per register, and emits an `lvx.sd` in the
prologue and an `lvx.ld` before every `lvx_func.return`. The save needs a
value to store, and a callee-saved register's incoming content has no
defining op, hence the `lvx.reg_live_in` pseudo (emits nothing, exactly like
`lvx.sp`); the restore needs no pseudo, since an `lvx.ld` whose result is
typed with the pinned register already *is* `ld $rN = off[$r12]`.

### Call clobbering

The base algorithm has no notion of calls, but `lvx_func.call` exists in
this IR, and real calling conventions clobber caller-saved registers across
a call. Ignoring this produces *silently wrong* code (not just suboptimal)
for any interval live across a call in a caller-saved register, once
callees actually use those registers.

**Original decision (superseded — unsound as stated)**: the walkthrough's
plan was to synthesize a zero-width fixed interval for each caller-saved
register at every call site and let it compete for `active` slots via the
normal fixed-interval machinery. Working through the implementation exposed
two problems with this:

1. **False positive at the boundary.** A value whose *last* use is the call
   itself (e.g. one of the call's own arguments) has `end == callNumber`.
   Fig. 1's `ExpireOldIntervals` only removes an interval when
   `end < newStart` (strict), so that value is still "active" — and holding
   some caller-saved register R — at the exact instant the synthetic
   clobber interval for R is inserted. That reads as a genuine register
   conflict and would hard-error on completely ordinary code (any call with
   arguments, essentially).
2. **Too late to matter.** For a value that *does* survive past the call
   while sitting in a caller-saved register — the real case this is meant
   to catch — the conflict is only visible once the scan reaches the call's
   position, by which point that value's register was already greedily
   assigned earlier in the scan. The base algorithm has no live-range
   splitting (Step 2/3 decision above), so there's nothing to *do* with the
   conflict at that point except wrongly error out on code a smarter
   allocator would accept.

**Revised mechanism**: decide *before* the greedy scan runs, per
allocation item (see the coalescing note below — an "item" may be a single
value or a coalesced loop-carried group), whether its `[start, end]` range
strictly contains at least one call site (`start < callNumber < end` —
strict on both ends, so a value merely produced or consumed *by* the call
itself doesn't count). Collect all `lvx_func.call` op numbers once up
front (sorted, for a cheap binary-search-style check) and precompute one
`crossesCall` bit per item. Register selection then restricts to the
callee-saved subset for any item with `crossesCall == true`; ordinary
items use the full preference order (below). No synthetic intervals, no
special-casing inside `ExpireOldIntervals` — the restriction happens purely
at the "which register do I hand out" step, which is a strictly simpler
place to enforce it than trying to retrofit a conflict into the active-list
scan after the fact.

### Loop-carried register coalescing (not anticipated in the walkthrough)

`lvx_scf::ForOp::verify()` requires
`initArgs[i].getType() == results[i].getType()` for every loop-carried
value, and `verifyRegions()` requires the matching `lvx_scf.yield` operand
type to equal that same type too. Concretely, for iter_arg index `i`, three
*distinct* SSA values — the init operand feeding the loop, the op's own
result, and the operand `lvx_scf.yield` produces at the end of the body —
must end up with the **identical** `!lvx.reg<rN>` type once allocated, or
the rewritten IR fails verification outright. (The in-body block argument,
`getRegionIterArgs()[i]`, is *not* constrained by the verifier to match —
but assigning it a different physical register than the channel it reads
from/feeds back into would be operationally wrong on real hardware, since
nothing in this IR inserts a register-to-register copy at the loop
boundary to reconcile a mismatch. So it's included in the group too.)

This wasn't visible while just computing live intervals (Step 1 treats
these as four ordinary, independently-computed SSA values — correctly, for
liveness purposes), but it is a hard constraint for Step 2, which actually
assigns architectural registers. Independently allocating the four values
would, in the `loop` test case already in the tree, very likely assign the
init operand and the loop's result *different* registers (their computed
Step-1 intervals — `[5, 6]` and `[6, 10]` in that test — merely touch at
one point, not overlap, so nothing in the base algorithm would naturally
force them together).

**Mechanism**: before running the scan, walk every `lvx_scf.for` in the
function and, for each iter_arg index, group `{initArg, bodyIterArg,
yieldOperand, result}` into one *allocation item* whose range is the union
of the four members' individual Step-1 intervals (`min(starts)` to
`max(ends)`). This item is what participates in the scan (one slot in
`active`, one register decision) instead of its four members
individually; once a register is chosen (or the item is fixed, if any
member happens to carry a `fixedReg` — conflicting fixed regs within one
group is a hard error, a malformed program), every member's SSA value gets
that same `!lvx.reg<rN>` type in the rewrite step. All other values
(including the loop's own induction variable, which has no life outside
the body) keep their individual Step-1 intervals unchanged.

### `lvx_cf` block-argument merges (fixed)

`lvx_cf.br`/`lvx_cf.cond_br` support passing operands into a destination
block's arguments, which is this dialect's only other value-merging
mechanism besides `lvx_scf.for`. This was originally left unimplemented on
the assumption that `ConvertToLVX` never lowers anything into a
value-carrying `lvx_cf` branch — **that assumption was wrong**: its
`FuncFuncToLVX` pattern always splits a function's entry block into an
ABI-argument-copy-in block that branches (with operands) into the real
body, for *every* function, not just ones with `scf.if`/`scf.while`. This
went unnoticed because every hand-written test in this project's history
used argument-less blocks for `lvx_cf.br`; it surfaced immediately (a
type-mismatch verifier error) the first time a real `-convert-to-lvx`
kernel was run through this pass end to end
(`EndToEndValidation.md`).

Fixed by extending `buildAllocItems`'s union-find pass — previously scoped
to `lvx_scf.for`'s loop-carried tuples only — to also walk every
`BranchOpInterface` op and unite each forwarded operand with the matching
destination block argument. This is the same JOIN/phi-coalescing idea as
the loop case, generalized: a block argument fed by more than one
predecessor unions every incoming operand and the argument itself into one
connected component, exactly like a real phi, with no special-casing
needed for the multi-predecessor case versus the single-predecessor one
that `FuncFuncToLVX` actually produces today.

### `ffma`/`ffms` accumulator coalescing

Real `FFMAD`/`FFMAW`/`FFMSD`/`FFMSW` (`lvx-mds` `Opcode.table`'s
`registerW_registerZ_registerY` shape, confirmed by hand-assembling with
the real `lvx-mbr-as` and round-tripping through `lvx-mbr-objdump`) have
only *two* explicit source registers -- the destination (`registerW`)
doubles as the third, implicit "accumulate into" operand. Real syntax is
`ffmad $rW = $rZ, $rY`, computing `$rW := $rZ * $rY [+|-] $rW` in place;
there is no separate destination field to encode a different register into.

This dialect's `LVX_FfmadOp`/`LVX_FfmawOp`/`LVX_FfmsdOp`/`LVX_FfmswOp`
still model it as an ordinary 3-independent-operand SSA op (`a`, `b`, `c`
→ `result`, no `SameOperandsAndResultType`-style constraint, consistent
with this dialect's general type-system stance -- top-level CLAUDE.md's
"type-system invariant to preserve"). Before this fix, nothing forced `c`'s
register and `result`'s register to be the same, so a real kernel using
these ops would, essentially always, get an instruction `-lvx-emit-asm`
had no correct way to print (the generic arity-based dispatch printed a
non-existent 4-register form, e.g. `ffmad $rd = $ra, $rb, $rc`, which the
real assembler rejects outright). Discovered while checking whether these
already-declared-but-never-exercised ops (`ops.mlir`'s only prior use was
a plain parser/printer round-trip test) could actually be generated
correctly end to end, the same "does this op existing prove it works"
question the divmod dual-output bug and the call ABI-pinning gap both
turned out to fail.

**Fix, in two parts, mirroring the `lvx_cf` block-argument coalescing
above:**

- `buildAllocItems`'s union-find pass also unites each `ffma`/`ffms` op's
  `c` operand with its own `result` -- the same JOIN-style idea as loop
  tuples and branch edges, just a 2-value group. A chain of accumulations
  (`c` of one op being a *later* op's own result) unions transitively into
  one group spanning the whole chain, which is exactly the real-hardware
  behavior of reusing one physical register as a running accumulator.
- Mirroring `insertLoopCarriedPreservingCopies`: if `c` is read anywhere
  *else* too (not just by this one op), that reader must not observe the
  register being overwritten in place. `insertFmaAccumulatorPreservingCopies`
  inserts an `lvx.mv` copy of `c` right before the op and redirects every
  other use to the copy, before Step 1 builds live intervals -- the op
  itself keeps reading the original value (so the coalescing above is
  unaffected), while the copy is an ordinary, independently allocated
  value for everyone else.

Also fixed alongside this: `LVX_FfmsdOp`/`LVX_FfmswOp`'s summary
previously read "`a*b-c`"; the real semantics (`f64_mulnAdd`/`f32_mulnAdd`
in `lvx-mds` `Opcode.table`) is `c - a*b` -- an actual sign bug in the
documented contract, not just a missing feature, since any future lowering
pattern written against the old text would compute the wrong sign.

Verified via the real `lvx-mbr-as`/`lvx-mbr-objdump` round-trip
(`emit-asm.mlir`'s `@ffma` case, which this file's own RUN line
re-assembles with the real toolchain on every test run), via
`register-allocation.mlir`'s `@ffma_preserve` case for the defensive-copy
path, and via real execution on `lvx-gem5` -- a genuine two-`ffma`-chain
kernel with non-trivial double operands, confirmed bit-exact (both
magnitude and sign) against an independently-computed fused result. See
`EndToEndValidation.md`, "`ffma`/`ffms` accumulator coalescing,
verified end to end" for the full account, including two since-fixed
`lvx-gem5` crashes this verification ran into along the way (floating-
point arithmetic, then comparisons -- both sibling-project ISS gaps, not
this fix's own correctness).

### Captured values across a re-entered loop (fixed)

Found while resuming work on the "hardware-loop clobber bug"
(`HardwareLoops.md`, bottom): a value defined outside an
`lvx_scf.for` and used inside its body (a "capture," in the closure
sense -- an outer-scope value referenced via plain SSA dominance, not
threaded through the loop's own `iter_args`) can end up sharing a
register with something defined *inside* that body, if the capture's own
last recorded use happens to fall exactly at the boundary Step 1's
numbering creates around a nested `lvx_scf.for`.

**Root cause**: `LiveIntervals.cpp`'s `numberBlock` assigns a nested
`lvx_scf.for`'s own number (say `N`, covering its `lb`/`ub`/`step`/
`iter_args` operand list), then *immediately* recurses into that for's
body, whose own block gets `N+1`. A captured value used only as that
nested for's own operand has its ordinary operand-tracked interval end
at `N`; the nested loop's own induction variable, a block argument of
the body, has its interval *start* at `N+1`. By the numeric [start, end]
check alone, these look like two cleanly back-to-back, non-overlapping
intervals -- free to share a register, the same way any two ordinary
sequential values would be. That reasoning is correct for a loop that
runs once, but wrong the instant that `lvx_scf.for` is itself nested
inside another loop: the *whole* body -- including whichever value now
occupies that shared register, and however it's been mutated by a full
pass through the inner loop -- re-executes on the next outer iteration,
at which point the operand reference that used to read the capture's
original value now reads whatever the inner loop's own machinery left
behind instead.

This is not specific to hardware loops (`loopdo`) -- the same numbering
gap exists for a branch-based re-entered inner loop too -- but it was
*found* via a hardware loop specifically, because `loopdo`'s
induction-variable lowering (`HardwareLoops.md`, "New subtlety
specific to hardware loops") increments its register in place, so a
collision there produces an obviously-wrong leftover value rather than
something a branch-based loop's own bookkeeping might happen to mask.

**Fix**: extend the *existing* mechanism that already does exactly this
for a loop's own induction variable and `step` operand (the "implicit
extra use" extension immediately above in `LiveIntervals.cpp`) to cover
*every* captured value, not just those two. `mlir::getUsedValuesDefinedAbove`
(`mlir/Transforms/RegionUtils.h` -- the same closure-capture utility
MLIR's own region-isolation transforms use) gives exactly the set of
values referenced anywhere inside a `lvx_scf.for`'s body, at any nesting
depth, but defined outside it; each gets its interval end extended to
that for-op's own body-end, same as iv/step. Applied at *every* nesting
level (`func.walk` visits each `lvx_scf.for`, inner and outer alike), a
value captured across multiple levels gets extended multiple times, and
the outermost extension always wins via the same `std::max` pattern used
throughout this file -- so a capture shared with the outermost re-entered
loop ends up protected for that loop's *entire* span, not just the
inner one's.

**Verified two ways.** Structurally: `scf-to-cf.mlir`'s pre-existing
`@nested` test already had this exact shape (a doubly-nested loop
reusing the same `%lb`/`%ub`/`%step` for both levels) without anyone
having noticed it was also exhibiting the bug -- before this fix, its
own CHECK lines showed `%11 = lvx.mv %0 : (!lvx.reg<r0>) -> !lvx.reg<r0>`,
a same-register self-copy (the inner loop's own induction-variable seed
literally sharing `%lb`'s register), "safe" only because the test never
checked what a second outer iteration would do. After the fix, that copy
lands in a fresh register (`r5`), and the self-copy is gone. On real
gem5: assembled/linked the exact `@nested` function, called with a
10-iteration outer loop (bound 0..10, step 1) each re-running a
10-iteration inner loop with the same bounds, accumulating the inner
loop's own result (`sum(0..9) = 45`) into the outer loop-carried value
each pass. Correct result is `450` (`45 × 10`, since every outer
iteration's inner loop must genuinely re-run with the right bounds);
before this fix (confirmed by temporarily reverting it and rebuilding),
the same kernel gave `45` -- the first outer iteration's inner sum
correct, then every subsequent outer iteration's `sbfd`-computed trip
count came out `0` (the corrupted `%lb` register making `ub - lb`
evaluate to `10 - 10`), so `loopdo`'s documented zero-trip-count
short-circuit (`HardwareLoops.md`, "Zero trip count is safe on
LVX") silently skipped every remaining inner loop entirely.

All 15 lit tests continue to pass (three CHECK blocks updated for the
now-longer, now-correct intervals: `live-intervals.mlir`'s `@loop`, and
`scf-to-cf.mlir`'s `@nested` and its own comment plus
`@nested_combined_accumulator`'s, which previously described this as a
known, unfixed limitation).

### Nested `lvx_scf.for`: coalescing across nesting levels (fixed)

Found while building `HardwareLoops.md`'s hardware-loop lowering
(unrelated to that feature specifically — a general gap in this step, now
fixed). A value that is simultaneously an inner loop's `result` (or
`initArg`, etc.) and an outer loop's own channel member needs to belong to
two independently-computed Step 2/3 coalescing groups at once, each of
which may pick a different register for it — there was no coordination
across nesting levels. Depending on the exact shape this either failed
`-lvx-allocate-registers`'s own verifier (`ForOp`'s type-equality check) or
corrupted state badly enough to crash `-lvx-scf-to-cf` outright (a second,
independent bug found alongside this one: `-lvx-scf-to-cf` collected its
for-ops via `Operation::walk`'s *default* order, which is post-order —
processing a nested loop before its containing one, so the inner loop's
own restructuring would split the outer loop's body out from under it
before the outer loop got its turn; fixed by walking pre-order instead).

**Fix**: `buildAllocItems` now runs a union-find over every loop's
`{initArg, iterArg, yieldOperand, result}` tuple, across *all* loops in the
function rather than one at a time, and builds one `AllocItem` per
resulting connected component instead of one per loop. A value shared
between an inner and outer loop's tuples transitively merges both loops'
entire channels into a single group sharing one register — mechanically
necessary since a single SSA value can't have two types, and this is the
minimal set of unions that makes every loop's own type-equality
requirement satisfiable simultaneously. Verified (including via real
disassembly through `-lvx-emit-asm` and the real `lvx-mbr-as`) for the
"inner loop's result directly becomes the outer loop's yielded value"
shape — a natural, common nested-accumulator pattern.

**Narrower gap discovered while verifying the fix (fixed)**: the
union-find's merges are *forced* by type-consistency, but "one shared
register" is not always semantically sound even when it's the only
type-consistent choice. If a value plays a loop-channel role in one loop
(e.g. an outer loop's `iterArg`, used as an inner loop's `initArg`) *and*
is also read again independently after that inner loop finishes, the
merge is still forced (the value can't have two types) — but the inner
loop's own iterations physically overwrite that shared register on the
way, so the later, independent read silently observes the wrong value.
Confirmed concretely: `%acc` fed into an inner loop as `iter_args(%acc)`,
then read again in `%sum = lvx.addd %acc, %innerResult` after the inner
loop -- both operands ended up pinned to the same register, compiling to
a self-add (`addd $r3 = $r3, $r3`) instead of the intended sum.

This is the same class of gap the literature comparison names precisely
(`LinearScanComparison.md`, Pereira & Palsberg 2009): CSSA's
Definition 1 requires that values sharing a register via a φ-merge (here,
the loop-carried channel) not *interfere* — `%acc` and the loop's own
channel members do interfere (`%acc`'s live range extends past the loop,
into the later read), so coalescing them was never safe. Fixed by
`insertLoopCarriedPreservingCopies` (`RegisterAllocation.cpp`), run
*before* Step 1 builds live intervals (a fixup inside `buildAllocItems`
itself would be too late to give a newly-inserted copy its own interval):
for every `lvx_scf.for` init operand with a use besides that one operand,
insert an explicit `lvx.mv` copy immediately before the loop and redirect
every other use to the copy. The loop's own channel still coalesces
around the original value exactly as before, unaffected; the copy is an
ordinary, independently allocated value whose interval naturally spans
the loop, handled by Step 2's normal conflict-avoidance like any other
long-lived value. Conservative by design (triggers on *any* other use,
not specifically one positioned after the loop) — confirmed to be a
no-op on every pre-existing loop test. Verified end to end, including
real execution on `lvx-gem5` (not just structural FileCheck): see
`scf-to-cf.mlir`'s `@nested_combined_accumulator` case.

### Multi-result ops

`lvx.divmodd`'s quotient+remainder need no special handling beyond each
result getting its own interval. LVX's real ISA is 3-address (no
2-address operand/result register reuse to model, unlike x86), so there's
no "coalesce dest with a source" concern either.

### Bail-out semantics

Two distinct hard-error cases, both `emitError` (via `value.getLoc()`,
which resolves correctly for both op results and block arguments) +
`signalPassFailure()`:

- A *fixed* item's register is already held by something else still in
  `active` when the fixed item is reached — a genuine ABI conflict in the
  IR itself (two overlapping values independently pinned to the same
  physical register). Not expected to trigger on any current lowering
  output, but worth a real diagnostic rather than an assert if it ever
  does, since it'd indicate a bug elsewhere (e.g. in `ConvertToLVX`) rather
  than in the allocator.
- A *non-fixed* item finds no free candidate in its allowed pool (full
  62-register order, or the callee-saved-only subset if `crossesCall`).
  This is the expected/designed bail-out this step exists to produce.

**Bug found and fixed while implementing this**: the first case above,
applied naively, spuriously fires on completely ordinary code. Consider
`%3 = ...; %4 = lvx.mv %3 : (!lvx.reg) -> !lvx.reg<r0>` — `%3`'s interval
ends at the same instruction number where `%4`'s fixed interval begins.
Fig. 1's own `ExpireOldIntervals` rule (`end < start`, strict) is exactly
what we *want* for two ordinary items sharing a boundary (it's what forces
an op's result into a different register than an operand it's still
reading — see "Multi-result ops" below) — but applied to a *fixed* item's
conflict check, that same strictness means `%3` reads as "still active,
still holding some register" at the exact instant `%4` needs to claim that
register, even when `%3`'s only remaining "use" is being consumed by the
very op that produces `%4`. Any `lvx.mv %x : (...) -> !lvx.reg<rN>` (the
standard ABI copy-out pattern used throughout this dialect) hits this if
`%x` happens to have been assigned register `rN` earlier in the scan — not
a rare coincidence, since low-numbered registers are early in the
preference order and thus commonly assigned. Fix: when checking a *fixed*
item for a conflict, first expire active items with `end <= start`
(inclusive), not just `end < start` — i.e. the boundary-inclusive rule
applies only to the fixed-item conflict check, not to ordinary
(non-fixed) `ExpireOldIntervals` calls, which keep Fig. 1's exact rule.
Caught by testing `@straight` (`mlir/test/Dialect/LVX/register-allocation.mlir`)
before this ever reached the user — every `!lvx.reg<rN>`-returning function
in the test suite exercises this pattern via its final `lvx.mv`.

### Output representation

Since the dialect's design principle is "physical registers as types,"
this pass rewrites every `!lvx.reg` operand/result type in place to its
assigned `!lvx.reg<rN>` via `Value::setType`, rather than producing an
out-of-band coloring map. No new ops are inserted (that's out of scope
until Step 3's spill/reload rewriting) — this step only ever changes
types.

### Implementation shape (as being built)

- `mlir/include/mlir/Dialect/LVX/Transforms/{Passes.td,Passes.h,CMakeLists.txt}`
  and `mlir/lib/Dialect/LVX/Transforms/{RegisterAllocation.cpp,CMakeLists.txt}`,
  mirroring the existing `ConvertToLVXPass` TableGen-based pass convention
  (`Passes.td` + `GEN_PASS_DECL`/`GEN_PASS_DEF`, registered from
  `mlir/lib/RegisterAllPasses.cpp` via `lvx::registerLVXPasses()`) rather
  than the test-only `PassWrapper` pattern Step 1's test pass used — this
  is a real, production pass, not a test probe.
- Pass name: `-lvx-allocate-registers`, scoped `OperationPass<lvx_func::FuncOp>`
  (`Pass<"lvx-allocate-registers", "::mlir::lvx_func::FuncOp">`), matching
  Step 1's per-function granularity.
- One test-only pass option, `max-registers` (default 62, the real pool
  size), letting lit tests exercise the bail-out path without hand-writing
  62 simultaneously-live values — set it low in a test to force a
  synthetic "ran out of registers" case.
- Internally: build a list of allocation items (individual Step-1
  intervals, except `lvx_scf.for` loop-carried groups collapsed per the
  coalescing rule above), each with `{values, start, end, fixedReg,
  crossesCall}`; sort by `start`; run Fig. 1's `ExpireOldIntervals` +
  assign-from-preference-order loop; rewrite types for every successfully
  assigned (or already-fixed) item's member values.

## Step 3 — Full linear scan with spill/restore

Step 3 extends the *same* `-lvx-allocate-registers` pass in place — it does
not add a second pass. Per the paper, Step 2 and Step 3 are the identical
Fig. 1 scan; the only difference is what happens when no register is free
(`SpillAtInterval` instead of a hard error). Concretely, this means Step 2's
own bail-out path mostly disappears: register pressure alone is no longer a
hard error, it now produces a spill. See "What remains a hard error" below
for what's still fatal.

### Spill heuristic

Exactly Fig. 1's `SpillAtInterval`: compare the current item's end against
the *furthest-end spillable* item in `active`; spill whichever ends later
(free its register for the other). "Spillable" excludes two kinds of
`active` members that can't be retroactively evicted: fixed/ABI-pinned
items (their register is a hard constraint, not a preference — see Step 2),
and coalesced `lvx_scf.for` loop-carried groups (spilling those isn't
implemented yet — see "What remains a hard error"). If the furthest-end
*spillable* item's end is still later than the current item's own end, spill
it and hand its register to the current item; otherwise (or if no spillable
active item exists at all) spill the current item itself.

### New op: `lvx.sp`

Spilling needs an SSA value typed `!lvx.reg<r12>` to use as the base operand
of `lvx.sd`/`lvx.ld` (R12 is `Convention.table`'s `stack` register, already
permanently reserved from the allocatable pool since Step 2). Nothing in the
dialect produces such a value out of thin air, so this adds
`lvx.sp` — a zero-operand pseudo-op, in the same "not a single real opcode,
but a needed SSA anchor" spirit as `lvx.li`/`lvx.mv` — that materializes
"the current stack-pointer value." The allocator inserts it once per
function that has at least one spill, at the very top of the entry block,
and always constructs its result with type `!lvx.reg<r12>` directly (it
never goes through general allocation).

### Reserved scratch registers

A spilled value is never resident in a register for its whole interval
(see "No interval splitting" below) — but the instruction that *defines* it
still writes to some real register before the store, and every reload
still needs a real register between the load and the use. These windows are
extremely short (one or two instructions) and, critically, are decided
*after* Step 2's main scan has already committed every other register —
there's no clean way to fold them into the same competitive scan without
either re-running it or reasoning about point-in-time free-register sets.

**Decision**: reserve a small fixed set of registers, excluded from the
general candidate pool from the start (so Phase 1 can never hand them to an
ordinary long-lived value), used exclusively for these transient
def-then-store / reload-then-use windows. Size: **3** — `r61`, `r62`, `r63`
(the tail of the caller-saved order; general pool shrinks from 62 to 59).

These must be **caller**-saved. The scratch window is transient and never
crosses a call, so nothing needs preserving across it — but a callee-saved
choice clobbers the caller's value in a register it is entitled to get back,
with no save to match. The original choice, `r29`-`r31`, was callee-saved,
which made every spilling function ABI-illegal against `lvx-gcc` callers;
`r62:r63` was picked to keep the even/odd aligned pair that
`lvx.divmodd`'s `registerM` destination requires. Three covers the worst case among currently-defined ops needing
simultaneous scratch registers: `lvx.cmoved`/`lvx.cmovew`'s three register
operands (if all three happened to be spilled at once) and
`lvx.divmodd`/`lvx.divmodud`/`lvx.divmodw`/`lvx.divmoduw`'s two results.
Operand reloads (before an op) and result stores (after it) never overlap in
time for the *same* op, so the bound is the max over either side, not their
sum. A single dedicated store-side scratch register would in fact always
suffice on its own (each def's hold-then-store window is a single,
non-overlapping point in the instruction stream), so reusing the same pool
for both roles costs nothing extra.

`lvx_func.call` can have up to 12 operands, though, and if more than 3 of a
single call's arguments are simultaneously spilled, 3 scratch registers
isn't enough. See "What remains a hard error."

### Frame layout and prologue/epilogue (resolves Step 1/2's open question)

**Decision**: yes, this pass emits the prologue/epilogue itself, rather
than deferring to a follow-up pass. Spilling isn't actually correct without
a reserved, non-clobbered stack area — an unaddressed spill area is exactly
the kind of bug the native-x86-differential ISS harness (see the lvx-csw
toolchain reference memory) would catch by actually running the code, so
it's worth getting right now rather than leaving a known-broken gap.

- Spill slots: bump-allocate 8-byte-aligned offsets from 0 (every `!lvx.reg`
  is a 64-bit LP64 value) as items are marked spilled during the scan;
  tracked in a per-function running `frameSize`.
- Prologue: only emitted if `frameSize > 0` (this now also covers the
  `$ra`-only case below). At the top of the entry block: `%sp0 = lvx.sp`,
  `%off = lvx.li frameSize : i64 : !lvx.reg<r61>`,
  `%spBase = lvx.sbfd %sp0, %off : (!lvx.reg<r12>, !lvx.reg<r61>) -> !lvx.reg<r12>`.
  `%spBase` is the `base` operand for every spill `lvx.sd`/`lvx.ld` in the
  function. `%off`'s type is pinned directly to `r61` (one of the reserved
  scratch registers above) at construction, rather than left unallocated for
  a later scan to assign — this pass runs strictly after Step 2/3's own
  scan, so nothing else would ever give it a register, and `-lvx-emit-asm`
  hard-errors on any unallocated value. Safe because `%off`/`%off2` each die
  immediately at their one use (the following `sbfd`/`addd`), non-overlapping
  with the adjacent `$ra` snapshot/restore's own r61 use at the same site
  (see "Return-address save/restore" below).
- Epilogue: before *every* `lvx_func.return` in the function (there can be
  more than one, reached via different `lvx_cf` blocks), mirror the
  subtraction with `lvx.addd` to restore R12 to its caller-supplied value,
  per the kv4-v1 ABI's callee-restores-SP requirement.

**Known fragility, documented rather than silently accepted**: the restored
SP value has no explicit "use" tying it to the return the way a real return
*value* would (`lvx_func.return`'s own operands are ordinary SSA uses; the
SP restore isn't one of them). Nothing currently strips supposedly-dead
code in this tree, so this doesn't bite today, but a future DCE-style pass
would need to know that a register-pinned result can carry a load-bearing
side effect even with zero real uses — or `lvx_func.return` would need to
grow an explicit (possibly implicit-in-the-syntax) epilogue-registers list.
Not fixed now; flagged so it isn't rediscovered the hard way later.

### Return-address save/restore

LVX has a single hardware link register, `$ra`, written implicitly by every
real `call` (there is no software call stack) and read implicitly by `ret`.
A non-leaf function — one that itself executes a `call` — must snapshot its
own `$ra` before making any call of its own, or that call silently
clobbers it, and the function's own eventual `ret` loops back into itself
forever. Confirmed both by reproducing the hang with hand-written assembly
on real gem5 (`EndToEndValidation.md`, bug 4) and by fixing it with
hand-written save/restore code that correctly returns.

Real opcodes, confirmed via `lvx-mds/lvx-refs/FE/YAML/lvx/lvx_v1/Description.yml`'s
CALL/RET entries and empirically via real `lvx-mbr-as`/`lvx-mbr-objdump`:
`get $rd = $ra` reads `$ra` into a GPR (`lvx.getra`); `set $ra = $rs` writes
a GPR into `$ra` (`lvx.setra`). Both are ordinary dialect ops (`lvx.getra`
is `Pure`; `lvx.setra` is not — the following `ret` implicitly depends on
its side effect).

**Mechanism**: `insertPrologueEpilogue` takes an optional `raOffset`. A
function is detected as non-leaf by walking it for any `lvx_func.call`; if
found, `raOffset` is appended *after* all spill slots (`raOffset =
frameSize; frameSize += 8`), forcing a prologue/epilogue to exist even when
nothing was spilled (`@caller` in `register-allocation.mlir` is the
minimal case: no spills, but still gets a full frame purely for `$ra`).
When `raOffset` is set:

- Right after the frame is established at function entry: `%raVal =
  lvx.getra : !lvx.reg<r61>`, `lvx.sd %raVal, %spBase, raOffset`.
- Right before each epilogue's stack-pointer restore (i.e. immediately
  before every `lvx_func.return`): `%raVal2 = lvx.ld %spBase, raOffset :
  !lvx.reg<r61>`, `lvx.setra %raVal2`.

Both use the same `r61` scratch register as `%off`/`%off2` above — safe by
the same transient, non-overlapping reasoning, and the two never execute
back-to-back without an intervening def/use that would create a real
conflict.

**Call ABI pinning was a separate, larger gap.** Verifying `$ra` end to end
with a real compiler-generated call surfaced two more pre-existing bugs,
both now fixed: `lvx_func.call` wasn't a `Terminator`, so
`-lvx-emit-asm`'s `emitBlock` routed it through the generic arity-based
dispatch instead of printing `call <callee>` (fixed by giving it its own
case in `emitOp`'s `TypeSwitch`, since a real `call` is not a terminator —
control returns to the very next instruction, so it can sit mid-block).
More fundamentally, `-convert-to-lvx`'s `CallToLVX` pattern never pinned a
call's operands/results to the ABI's argument ($r0-$r11) / result
($r0-$r3) registers at all — Step 1-3's general scan was free to assign
them anywhere, not necessarily where the callee actually expects/produces
them. Fixed by mirroring `ReturnToLVX`'s copy-in and `FuncFuncToLVX`'s
copy-out patterns: `lvx.mv` each operand into its pinned argument register
immediately before the `lvx_func.call`, and `lvx.mv` each pinned result
back into a fresh virtual register immediately after. Verified end to end
on real gem5 with a genuine two-level call chain
(`EndToEndValidation.md`).

### No interval splitting / no lifetime holes

Matches the paper's stated base algorithm (explicitly contrasted against
"second-chance binpacking" in §2 as a *more* complex extension, not the
default): once a value is spilled, it's memory-resident for its entire
original interval; every use gets a fresh reload into a short-lived
temporary register right before that use, and the defining instruction's
result is stored immediately after being produced.

Mechanically this needs no renumbering or second scan: a spilled value's
def site (`Value::getDefiningOp()`, or "top of its owning block" for a
block argument — the only block-argument case in practice is a spilled
`lvx_scf.for` induction variable, since function entry args are always
fixed and loop iter_args are coalesced groups) and its uses
(`Value::getUses()`, walked via `llvm::make_early_inc_range` since each use
is rewritten to point at a fresh reload in place) are enough on their own;
insertion is always relative to still-existing ops, never to Step 1's
now-stale instruction numbers.

### What remains a hard error

Two cases, beyond Step 2's existing fixed-item-ABI-conflict check:

- **Spilling a coalesced `lvx_scf.for` loop-carried group.** Correctly
  spilling one needs a reload once per iteration (at the top of the loop
  body) plus a store after each iteration's new value is computed, not the
  single def/use treatment ordinary values get — genuinely more work, not
  yet implemented. `SpillAtInterval` excludes groups from its spill
  candidates entirely (see "Spill heuristic"); if a group itself is the
  item that can't get a register, that's the hard error, with a message
  naming it explicitly rather than mis-spilling it.
- **More than 3 simultaneously-reloaded operands at one instruction**
  (realistically only reachable via `lvx_func.call` with many spilled
  arguments, since every other current op has at most 3 register
  operands). Caught at rewrite time per instruction; documented scope limit
  rather than a silent scratch-register collision.

### Testing note

The `max-registers` test option (added in Step 2) still exists and is now
how lit tests force spilling deterministically without hand-writing dozens
of live values — but its meaning shifts: under Step 3, shrinking the pool
no longer reliably produces a hard error, it produces spill code. Step 2's
`register-allocation-invalid.mlir` (which asserted a bail-out purely from
register pressure) is no longer a valid test of *that* scenario and is
updated to exercise one of the two hard-error cases above instead.

## Confirmed decisions (recap)

- Reuse `mlir::Liveness` as the dataflow engine (not hand-rolled).
- Model call sites as clobbering all caller-saved registers, from Step 2
  onward (not deferred) — via a precomputed per-item `crossesCall`
  restriction (see above), not synthetic fixed intervals as originally
  sketched.
- `lvx_scf.for` loop-carried values (init operand / body iter_arg / yield
  operand / result) are coalesced into one allocation item per iter_arg
  index, required by `ForOp`'s own verifier — not anticipated in the
  original walkthrough, discovered while designing Step 2.
- General `lvx_cf` block-argument merges are *not* coalesced in Step 2
  (documented known limitation, not currently reachable from any lowering
  path).
- `R14` allocatable in Step 2; revisited when Step 3 introduces stack
  frames.
- Step 1 gets its own standalone test pass
  (`-lvx-print-live-intervals`), separate from the allocation pass itself.
  Step 2 is a real, TableGen-registered pass (`-lvx-allocate-registers`),
  not a test-only probe.
